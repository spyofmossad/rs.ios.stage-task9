Motorcycle gymkhana is a motorcycle time trial sport in which riders compete to maneuvre in the shortest time through a paved course restricted by traffic cones or other obstacles. Motorcycle gymkhana is especially popular in Japan.

After walking the course to familiarize themselves with the obstacles, participants ride through individually in a predetermined order. Each rider runs the course once in the morning and once in the afternoon, and his fastest time determines his placing.
